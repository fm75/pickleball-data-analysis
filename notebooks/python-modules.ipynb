    "## Context from Previous Work: Video Calibration and Ball Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goal\n",
    "Empirically determine the coefficient of drag for a pickleball by analyzing high-speed video of its free fall in front of a 2'×8' pegboard backdrop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Video Characteristics\n",
    "- File: `freefall.mp4`\n",
    "- Actual frame count: 70 frames (metadata reported 74)\n",
    "- Frame rate: ~54.7 fps\n",
    "- Resolution: 2160×3840 pixels\n",
    "- Useful frames for analysis: frames 11-63 (ball fully visible)\n",
    "- Horizontal crop region: x = 800 to 1200 pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ball Detection Method\n",
    "**HSV Color Thresholding** proved highly effective:\n",
    "- Convert frame to HSV color space\n",
    "- Threshold range: H=[30,80], S=[40,255], V=[40,255]\n",
    "- Use `cv2.moments()` to find centroid (cx, cy)\n",
    "- Use `cv2.findContours()` and `cv2.minEnclosingCircle()` for radius\n",
    "- Function `detect_and_draw_ball(frame, mask)` returns: result image, cx, cy, radius\n",
    "\n",
    "### Camera Calibration\n",
    "**Camera tilt angle: 2.14°**\n",
    "- Measured from ball positions at frames 11 and 63\n",
    "- Ball fell 3507 pixels vertically, drifted 131 pixels horizontally (left)\n",
    "- Angle = arctan(131/3507) = 2.14°\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pegboard angle: 0.34° ± 0.06°** (essentially vertical, negligible)\n",
    "- Used Hough circle detection on vertical slice of pegboard\n",
    "- Parameters: `minDist=20, param2=7, minRadius=5, maxRadius=8`\n",
    "- Detected 60 peg holes across 6 columns\n",
    "- K-means clustering (n_clusters=6) separated columns\n",
    "- Linear fit to each column gave consistent angles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Calibration\n",
    "**Pixels per inch: 38.61 pixels/inch**\n",
    "- Pegboard holes spaced exactly 1 inch apart\n",
    "- Rotated detected hole positions by camera angle (2.14°)\n",
    "- Filtered for gaps < 50 pixels (adjacent holes)\n",
    "- Averaged 15 measurements across all 6 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate Transformation\n",
    "Function `rotate_points(points, angle_degrees)` applies rotation matrix to correct for camera tilt, converting observed (x,y) to true vertical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. Apply ball detection to all frames 11-63\n",
    "2. Extract and transform (x,y,t) data\n",
    "3. Convert pixel measurements to physical units (feet/inches)\n",
    "4. Export time-displacement data to CSV for drag coefficient regression"

    "**Option 1: transforms in `vision/`**\n",

    "- Con: Analysis needs to know about camera geometry\n",
    "\n",

    "The reason I was thinking about Option 2 \n",
